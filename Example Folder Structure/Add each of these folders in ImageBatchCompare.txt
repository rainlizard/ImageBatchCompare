For this example:

1. Open Image Batch Comparison tool
2. Click 'Add Folder' then navigate to this Example Folder Structure
3. Add each directory
4. Then click "Start Comparison"

You can also use 'Add subfolders' to add all folders at once. Or drag folders into the window.

The precise filenames of each file don't matter. Only the order of the files matters, so that the order is the same across each folder.
But you should give accurate names to each folder name, as the final score tells you which folder name recieved the most points.
