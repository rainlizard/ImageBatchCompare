A simple tool for comparing groups of images between folders.

You select a few folders and then it displays and compares the first images it finds in each of those folders.
For example if you have 6 folders it will display 6 images to you at once, in a randomized order. You then pick the best one by clicking on it, then it displays the 2nd image it finds in all those 6 folders. And so on.
At the end of the comparison it gives you a score, for the folder that contains the images that you clicked on the most.
